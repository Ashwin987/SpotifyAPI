Save Discover Weekly Playlists
Spotify's weekly playlists provide a curated collection of songs for your enjoyment, but they are only available for a limited time â€“ typically a week. Once the week is over, these playlists disappear, and you lose access to the songs you enjoyed. The Spotify Weekly Playlist Archiver API aims to solve this problem by automatically creating a new playlist that contains all the tracks from your current weekly playlist, ensuring that you can continue listening to these songs beyond the limited timeframe.
