Save Discover Weekly Playlists
Spotify's weekly playlists provide a curated collection of songs for your enjoyment, but they are only available for a limited time â€“ typically a week. Once the week is over, these playlists disappear, and you lose access to the songs you enjoyed. The Spotify Weekly Playlist Archiver API aims to solve this problem by automatically creating a new playlist that contains all the tracks from your current weekly playlist, ensuring that you can continue listening to these songs beyond the limited timeframe.


# Features
* Automated Archiving: The API automatically detects your current weekly playlist and creates a new playlist with the same songs, allowing you to keep listening to your favorite tracks.
* Easy Integration: The API offers a simple endpoint for archiving playlists, making it easy to integrate into your own applications or scripts.
* Authorization: Securely authenticate and authorize the API to access your Spotify account using the OAuth 2.0 authorization framework.

#Prerequisites

Before using the Spotify Weekly Playlist Archiver API, you'll need the following:

   * A Spotify developer account.
   * API credentials: Client ID and Client Secret from your Spotify developer account.
   * Basic understanding of making HTTP requests.
